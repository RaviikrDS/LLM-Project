Requirement Document: GenAI-Powered Email and Ticket Response Automation System

1. Project Title

Intelligent Email and Ticket Response Automation Using GenAI


---

2. Objective

Leverage GenAI to draft context-aware responses to service tickets and emails by using historical data, SOPs, and relevant documents. The system should automate classification, prioritization, and response generation for emails and tickets to reduce turnaround time, human error, and manual effort.


---

3. Scope

Automate email/ticket classification, prioritization, and response generation.

Reduce turnaround time (TAT) for response.

Enable accurate, consistent, and efficient responses based on historical patterns and trained models.

Integrate with existing ticketing/email systems (e.g., Outlook, ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk).

Provide auditability and feedback loop for continuous learning.



---

4. Expected Outcomes

Categorize incoming emails/tickets based on priority and routing logic.

Provide automated responses based on trained GenAI models.

Access structured historical data from Knowledge Bases (KBs), SOPs, and past tickets.

Achieve at least 5% capacity improvement in human resources involved.

Enable standard responses per category to maintain consistency.

Ensure reduced effort spent on reading/responding manually.



---

5. Roadblocks & Mitigations

Roadblock	Mitigation

Time to respond (Turnaround time)	Use GenAI-generated drafts to speed up replies
Human error	Implement a review workflow to minimize errors
Variation in responses	Use standard templates & GenAI training on historical data
No priority classification	Train model for urgency/priority detection
Capacity involved	Reduce human workload via automation
Bandwidth and effort on email reading	Use NLP-based summarization and routing



---

6. Functional Requirements

6.1 Email/Ticket Ingestion

Ingest incoming emails or tickets via configured inbox or API.

Extract metadata (sender, subject, timestamp).


6.2 Categorization & Prioritization

Classify emails into predefined categories (e.g., Technical, HR, Sales, Support).

Detect priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Urgent) based on content.


6.3 Response Generation

Use GenAI to generate suggested responses based on:

Email context

SOPs, KB articles, historical replies


Include editable drafts for human review if needed.


6.4 Feedback Loop

Capture user edits and feedback for model fine-tuning.

Store actual responses to improve accuracy.


6.5 Dashboard & Analytics

Monitor categorized tickets, response times, and accuracy.

Track automation coverage and user satisfaction.



---

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Sub-second response draft generation.

Scalability: Handle high volumes of emails/tickets.

Security: Data privacy and secure access (especially for sensitive content).

Compliance: Adhere to organizational data governance standards.

Availability: 99.9% uptime.



---
