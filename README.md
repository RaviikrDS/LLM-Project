üîç Problem Statement

Title: Inefficiency and Inconsistency in Manual Email & Ticket Responses in Service Environments


---

Background

Organizations today receive a high volume of emails and service tickets from customers, employees, and partners daily. These messages require timely classification, prioritization, and appropriate responses. However, much of this process is still manual, leading to inefficiencies, inconsistent communication, and increased workload for service teams.


---

Current Challenges Identified

1. Time to Respond (Turnaround Time - TAT)

Agents take significant time to read, understand, and reply to each email or ticket manually.

High TAT results in poor customer satisfaction and delays in resolution.



2. High Dependency on Human Capacity

Every ticket requires human intervention, leading to increased cost and resource dependency.

Human bandwidth becomes a bottleneck, especially during peak hours or high-volume periods.



3. Lack of Standardized Responses

Different agents respond in different ways to similar issues, resulting in communication inconsistency.

No central repository or intelligence system is used to suggest standard replies.



4. Effort Spent on Reading and Understanding Emails

A large chunk of effort is wasted in just reading through lengthy email threads and attachments before responding.



5. No Categorization or Prioritization

Incoming messages are not automatically categorized or marked with urgency.

This leads to misrouted tickets, SLA breaches, and unresolved high-priority cases.



6. Error-Prone Manual Responses

Under pressure or due to human fatigue, agents may respond incorrectly or overlook important parts of the message.





---

Need for a Solution

There is a strong need for an automated, intelligent, and scalable system that can:

Automatically ingest and understand incoming messages.

Categorize and prioritize tickets/emails.

Generate accurate, context-aware response drafts.

Use historical data, SOPs, and KB articles for better response quality.

Learn and improve over time through human feedback.

Reduce the load on human agents while ensuring consistent, professional communication.



---

Goal

To design and implement a GenAI-powered, multi-agent response automation system that addresses the above problems by mimicking the human support flow in a smarter, faster, and more scalable way‚Äîultimately improving resolution speed, consistency, and efficiency.

Certainly! Here's a professional yet simplified version of the requirements for your GenAI-based Email and Ticket Automation System with Multi-Agent Architecture:


---

‚úÖ Requirements: GenAI-Powered Email & Ticket Automation System


---

1. Email & Ticket Ingestion

Automatically fetch incoming emails or tickets from platforms like Outlook, Gmail, ServiceNow, or Jira.

Extract key fields: subject, sender, timestamp, body content, and attachments.

Store the raw data securely for processing.



---

2. Categorization & Prioritization

Classify each email/ticket into predefined categories (e.g., Technical Issue, Billing, HR, etc.).

Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) using NLP models trained on historical data.

Handle low-confidence cases by escalating to human review.



---

3. AI-Powered Response Generation

Use GenAI (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate context-aware reply drafts.

Include relevant information from past conversations, knowledge base, and SOPs.

Generate multiple drafts if needed for selection.



---

4. Knowledge Retrieval

Search and retrieve relevant KB articles or SOPs using vector search (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).

Inject retrieved context into the GenAI prompt to improve accuracy and relevance.



---

5. Human-in-the-Loop Review

Enable optional human review of AI-generated replies before sending.

Allow edits, approvals, or complete re-writes.

Track feedback and corrections for training.



---

6. Learning and Improvement

Capture feedback and user edits to improve future responses.

Schedule retraining or fine-tuning based on collected data.



---

7. Workflow Orchestration

Use an orchestrator to manage the sequence of agent actions:

Ingestion ‚Üí Classification ‚Üí Knowledge Retrieval ‚Üí GenAI Reply ‚Üí Human Review (if needed)


Implement retry, error handling, and logging for all steps.



---

8. Dashboard & Monitoring

Real-time dashboard to track:

Number of processed emails/tickets

Automation success rate

Turnaround time (TAT)

Manual vs automated handling


Alert system for failures or SLA breaches.



---

9. Multi-Agent System Requirements

Agent	Responsibilities

Ingestion Agent	Fetch and parse incoming emails/tickets.
Classification Agent	Categorize and prioritize messages using NLP.
Knowledge Retrieval Agent	Search internal docs to assist in responses.
GenAI Agent	Generate context-aware replies using LLMs.
Reviewer Agent	Allow human intervention and capture feedback.
Orchestrator Agent	Manage agent sequence, handle errors, and ensure smooth flow.
Feedback Agent	Learn from edits and retrain models periodically.
Monitoring Agent	Track system performance and display in dashboard.
